# Signtature: An  Interactive Canvas Trail

This project creates an interactive canvas element that generates a trailing effect following the user's mouse or touch input. The trail gradually fades and thins out, creating a visually appealing animation.

## Features

- Responsive canvas that adapts to window size
- Smooth trailing effect that follows mouse/touch input
- Automatic animation when no user input is detected
- Customizable trail properties (length, width, spring effect, friction)
